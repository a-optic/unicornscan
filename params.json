{"name":"Unicornscan","tagline":"Unicornscan - Fast Portscanner","body":"Developed by Jack Louis and Robert E. Lee.\r\n\r\n### Updates:\r\n\r\nSat Jan 5 0:00:00 CET 2013\r\n\r\nHappy Birthday Jack! :)\r\n\r\nUnicornscan packages now available for [Slackware 14].(https://sourceforge.net/projects/osace/files/unicornscan/Slackware%20Package/)\r\n\r\nSat Feb 27 8:00:02 CET 2010\r\n\r\nUnicornscan now available for [Fedora](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/unicornscan). Special thanks to Robert Scheck and JÃ¶rg Simon.\r\n\r\n### Overview:\r\n\r\nUnicornscan is a new information gathering and correlation engine built for and by members of the security research and testing communities. It was designed to provide an engine that is Scalable, Accurate, Flexible, and Efficient. It is released for the community to use under the terms of the GPL license.\r\n\r\n### Benefits:\r\n\r\nUnicornscan is an attempt at a User-land Distributed TCP/IP stack. It is intended to provide a researcher a superior interface for introducing a stimulus into and measuring a response from a TCP/IP enabled device or network. Although it currently has hundreds of individual features, a main set of abilities include:\r\n\r\nAsynchronous stateless TCP scanning with all variations of TCP Flags.\r\nAsynchronous stateless TCP banner grabbing\r\nAsynchronous protocol specific UDP Scanning (sending enough of a signature to elicit a response).\r\nActive and Passive remote OS, application, and component identification by analyzing responses.\r\nPCAP file logging and filtering\r\nRelational database output\r\nCustom module support\r\nCustomized data-set views\r\n\r\n### GETTING STARTED.\r\n\r\nTo begin, please read this [getting started guide](http://www.unicornscan.org/text/Unicornscan-Getting_Started.pdf)  You may also wish to go through the DEFCON [presentation](https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-13/dc13-presentations/DC_13-Lee.pdf) we gave to launch the tool.
